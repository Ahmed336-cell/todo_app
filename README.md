The Todo Tasks app allows users to manage their tasks effortlessly. Adding a task is as simple as providing a title, optional details, and setting a deadline. Completed tasks can be checked off, and incomplete tasks with approaching or expired deadlines are visually highlighted. Users have the option to edit task details at any time. To remove a task, a long press on the task triggers its deletion. This streamlined app offers a seamless way to stay organized and on top of your to-do list
